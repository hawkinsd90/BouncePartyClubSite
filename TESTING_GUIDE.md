# Complete Booking & Two-Way SMS Communication Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide will walk you through testing the complete booking flow including SMS notifications, two-way SMS conversations, Street View integration, and customer reply handling.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Twilio Setup (for SMS notifications and two-way messaging)
To enable actual SMS sending and receiving, you need to configure Twilio:

1. **Create a Twilio account** at https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio
2. **Get your credentials** from the Twilio Console:
   - Account SID
   - Auth Token
   - Twilio Phone Number (get one from Console)
3. **Configure Supabase Environment Variables**:
   - Go to your Supabase Dashboard
   - Navigate to Project Settings > Edge Functions
   - Add these secrets:
     - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`: Your Twilio Account SID
     - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Twilio Auth Token
     - `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`: Your Twilio phone number (format: +1234567890)

4. **Configure Twilio Webhook** (for receiving customer replies):
   - In Twilio Console, go to Phone Numbers > Manage > Active numbers
   - Click on your phone number
   - Scroll to "Messaging Configuration"
   - Under "A MESSAGE COMES IN", select "Webhook"
   - Set the URL to: `https://0ec90b57d6e95fcbda19832f.supabase.co/functions/v1/twilio-webhook`
   - Set HTTP method to: "HTTP POST"
   - Click "Save"

**Note**: If Twilio is not configured, the SMS function will run in "mock mode" and log what would have been sent without actually sending SMS.

### 2. Google Maps API Key
Your `.env` file should already have `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` set for Street View to work.

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Create a Test Booking (as Customer)

1. **Navigate to "Get Quote"** page
2. **Choose event type**:
   - Select "Residential" or "Commercial"
3. **Fill out the booking form**:
   - **Address**: Enter a real address with autocomplete
     - Example: "123 Main St, Detroit, MI"
   - **Event Date**: Choose a future date (e.g., tomorrow)
   - **Start Time**: 09:00 AM
   - **End Time**: 05:00 PM
   - **Pickup preference**:
     - Residential: Choose "Same Day" or "Next Morning"
     - Commercial: Automatically set to "Same Day"
   - **Check the responsibility agreement checkbox**
4. **Add inflatables to cart**:
   - Click "Add to Cart" on 2-3 different units
5. **Click "Continue to Checkout"**
6. **Fill out checkout information**:
   - **First Name**: John
   - **Last Name**: Doe
   - **Email**: your-test-email@example.com
   - **Phone**: (313) 555-0123
   - **Payment Amount**: Choose "Deposit" (default)
   - **Check "Card on File Authorization" checkbox**
7. **Click "Place Order"**
8. **Confirmation screen appears**:
   - Note the Order ID displayed
   - You should see a success message

### Step 2: Check SMS Notification

**If Twilio is configured:**
- Within seconds, the phone number (313) 889-3860 should receive an SMS like:
  ```
  ðŸŽˆ NEW BOOKING! John Doe for 2025-10-03. Review at: https://yourdomain.com/admin Order #a1b2c3d4
  ```

**If Twilio is NOT configured:**
- Check the browser console (F12 â†’ Console tab)
- You'll see: "Twilio credentials not configured. SMS sending disabled."
- The order is still created successfully

### Step 3: Sign In as Admin

1. **Click "Login"** in the top-right header
2. **Click "Create Demo Accounts"** button (if not already created)
3. **Sign in with admin credentials**:
   - Email: `admin@bouncepartyclub.com`
   - Password: `admin123`
4. **You're redirected to the Admin dashboard**

### Step 4: Review Booking with Street View

1. **The "Pending Review" tab** should be active by default
2. **You'll see the pending booking card** showing:
   - Customer name, email, phone
   - Order ID and timestamp
   - Event date and location address
   - **Street View image** of the event location (if API key is configured)
     - Shows a street-level view of the address
     - Includes a note about image currency
   - List of ordered inflatables
   - Total amount and pricing breakdown
   - **SMS Conversation section** (if any messages exist)
   - Two action buttons: "Approve" and "Reject"

**Street View Assessment:**
- The Street View image helps you quickly assess:
  - Property type (residential, commercial, park, etc.)
  - Available space for inflatables
  - Accessibility for delivery vehicles
  - Ground surface (grass vs concrete)

**Note**: Street View images may be outdated, so always verify during delivery

### Step 5: Approve the Booking

1. **Click "Approve & Process Payment"** button
2. **Confirm the action** in the popup dialog
3. **System actions performed**:
   - Order status changes from `pending_review` â†’ `confirmed`
   - Payment status changes from `pending` â†’ `succeeded`
   - Deposit amount is marked as paid
   - Customer receives confirmation (message record created)
4. **Success alert appears**: "Booking approved! Customer will receive confirmation."
5. **The booking disappears** from the Pending Review tab

### Step 6: Verify Database Changes

You can verify the changes in the database:

```sql
-- View the order
SELECT id, status, deposit_paid_cents, created_at
FROM orders
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- View the payment
SELECT order_id, status, amount_cents
FROM payments
WHERE order_id = 'YOUR_ORDER_ID';

-- View messages created
SELECT to_email, template_key, status
FROM messages
WHERE order_id = 'YOUR_ORDER_ID';
```

### Step 7: Test Two-Way SMS Communication

**Sending SMS from Admin Dashboard:**

1. **While viewing a pending booking**, scroll to the SMS Conversation section
2. **Click "Reply via SMS"** button
3. **Type a message**: "Hi John, your booking is confirmed! We'll arrive at 9:00 AM. Reply if this time doesn't work."
4. **Click "Send SMS"**
5. **If Twilio is configured**:
   - Customer receives the SMS on their phone
   - Message appears in the conversation thread (blue bubble on right)
   - Customer can reply to the SMS

**Receiving Customer Replies:**

1. **Customer texts back** to your Twilio number
   - Example: "Can you come at 10 AM instead?"
2. **Twilio webhook automatically**:
   - Receives the message
   - Stores it in the `sms_conversations` table
   - Links it to the correct order (by matching customer phone)
   - Sends auto-reply: "Thank you for your message! We've received it and will respond shortly."
3. **Refresh the Admin page**
   - Customer's reply appears in conversation (gray bubble on left)
   - Shows timestamp
4. **Admin can reply again**:
   - Click "Reply via SMS"
   - Type: "Yes, 10 AM works! See you then."
   - Customer receives the reply

**SMS Conversation Features:**
- Messages are threaded by order
- Inbound messages (from customer) appear on the left in gray
- Outbound messages (from admin) appear on the right in blue
- All messages show timestamps
- Conversation history is preserved

### Step 8: Test Rejection Flow (Optional)

1. **Create another test booking** (Steps 1-3)
2. **Sign in as admin** and navigate to Pending Review
3. **Click "Reject Booking"** button
4. **Enter rejection reason**: "Units not available for that date"
5. **Confirm rejection**
6. **System actions performed**:
   - Order status changes to `cancelled`
   - Payment status changes to `cancelled`
   - Customer receives rejection notice (message record created with reason)
7. **Success alert appears** with your rejection message

## Additional Notes

### Admin Phone Configuration
The admin notification phone is stored in the `admin_settings` table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM admin_settings WHERE key = 'admin_notification_phone';
```

You can update it:
```sql
UPDATE admin_settings
SET value = '+19876543210'
WHERE key = 'admin_notification_phone';
```

### Message Templates
Currently these message templates are referenced:
- `deposit_receipt`: Sent to customer after booking
- Future: `booking_confirmed`: Sent when admin approves
- Future: `booking_rejected`: Sent when admin rejects

### Edge Function URLs

**Send SMS (outbound):**
```
https://0ec90b57d6e95fcbda19832f.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-sms-notification
```

Test it directly:
```bash
curl -X POST https://0ec90b57d6e95fcbda19832f.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-sms-notification \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to":"+13138893860","message":"Test message"}'
```

**Twilio Webhook (inbound):**
```
https://0ec90b57d6e95fcbda19832f.supabase.co/functions/v1/twilio-webhook
```

This URL must be configured in Twilio Console for receiving customer replies.
