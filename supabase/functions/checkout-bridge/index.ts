/**
 * CHECKOUT BRIDGE PAGE - Supabase Edge Function
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * This edge function acts as a "bridge" between Stripe and the main application window.
 * After a successful Stripe payment, this page receives the redirect, extracts payment data,
 * sends it back to the original window via postMessage, and closes itself.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS:
 * - Stripe redirects to this page after successful payment (hosted on Supabase domain)
 * - This page is always accessible with no CORS issues (unlike localhost or dev URLs)
 * - It enables communication between Stripe's redirect and your app's main window
 * - Solves the problem of Stripe not being able to redirect to local development URLs
 *
 * FLOW:
 * 1. Stripe redirects here: /checkout-bridge?orderId=xxx&session_id=yyy&origin=zzz
 * 2. Page loads and extracts query parameters
 * 3. JavaScript immediately runs (inline in HTML)
 * 4. postMessage sends payment data to window.opener (the original checkout tab)
 * 5. window.close() attempts to close this tab/window
 * 6. Original tab receives message and navigates to booking confirmation
 *
 * URL PARAMETERS:
 * - orderId: UUID of the order in our database
 * - session_id: Stripe checkout session ID (replaced by Stripe from {CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID})
 * - origin: Target origin for postMessage security (e.g., https://yoursite.com)
